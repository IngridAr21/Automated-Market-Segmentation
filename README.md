# Automated Market Segmentation Project

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to automate market segmentation in Business-to-Business (B2B) contexts. Specifically, it applies agglomerative hierarchical clustering for macro-segmentation and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to analyze the customer journey for micro-segmentation.

To evaluate the models, synthetic datasets were generated, as real-world datasets with sufficient granularity are scarce. The results show that hierarchical clustering performs well in macro-segmentation but struggles with the complexity of micro-segmentation. 

### My Contributions
In this project, I contributed by:
- Developing the customer journey model using LSTM.
- Implementing data generation for customer journey analysis.
- Building the Graphical User Interface (GUI) using HTML, Flask, and CSS.
